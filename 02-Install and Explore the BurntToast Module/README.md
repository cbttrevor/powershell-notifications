## Learning Objective

In this video, we'll install the [BurntToast PowerShell module](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast).
We'll be using the built-in PowerShell command `Install-Module` to perform installation from the PowerShell Gallery.

Once installed, we'll explore the basic functionality of the module using built-in PowerShell introspection commands.
`Get-Module` allows you to explore the module installed on the local system, and modules currently loaded into the PowerShell session.
`Get-Command` allows you to explore the commands that are "exported" (exposed) by a PowerShell module.
